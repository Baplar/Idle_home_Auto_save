# Idle home Auto save

![init_gui_1_1_4](https://github.com/fuzzyCute/Idle_home_Auto_save/assets/22378193/57ba078e-2074-4ca5-b8ab-9af4943f510e)

An auto save program that allows you to save a game from the vrchat world [Idle Home](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_c16e4dee-d149-4116-adbc-16bc30b664b0)
This works by going to vrchat's log file and getting the save string that you'd get when you click on the save button, or when it auto saves

## How to use the program
2 ways:

### Compiled executable
Just run the executable that exists on the [releases page](https://github.com/fuzzyCute/Idle_home_Auto_save/releases/tag/version_1_1_4)

### Running the python code yourself
Install the package and its dependencies (only once):
```
python -m pip install .
```

After installing locally, start the program with:
```
pythonw -m idle_home_auto_save
```
Or if youâ€™re on Windows, just launch [`auto_save.bat`](./auto_save.bat) which does just that command !

## The GUI

Once you open the program this little window will show up
HEre's what you need to do on each step:
* 1 - When you click on the button another window will pop up, you'll have to choose where you want the file to be saved
* 2 - Give a name and an extension to your file, could be anything. The example I give is save.txt
* 3 - Give a number, this will represent the interval between log checks.
* 4 - Just start the program.

When you're done it'll start the program and you'll end up with a file with your save codes like in the image below

If you want to just copy the last saved string to your clipboard just click on the button (5)

If you want you can open the file clicking on button (6) and it'll open a file like the one below

You can also ignore the line limite by checking the checkbox (7)

I did this tool because I'm a bit lazy, but I held no responsibility for what could happen if you run this

Have a good day!
