# Idle home Auto save

![init_gui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22378193/236650657-518d8a39-ba21-4be3-a678-9cfa75b71433.PNG)

An auto save program that allows you to save a game from the vrchat world [Idle Home](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_c16e4dee-d149-4116-adbc-16bc30b664b0)
This works by going to vrchat's log file and getting the save string that you'd get when you click on the save button, or when it auto saves

## How to use the program
2 ways:
* Downloading python and running the program yourself
* Just run the executable that exists on the [releases page](https://github.com/fuzzyCute/Idle_home_Auto_save/releases/tag/version_1_1)

## The GUI

Once you open the program this little window will show up
HEre's what you need to do on each step:
* 1 - When you click on the button another window will pop up, you'll have to choose where you want the file to be saved
* 2 - Give a name and an extension to your file, could be anything. The example I give is save.txt
* 3 - Give a number, this will represent the interval between log checks.
* 4 - Just start the program.

When you're done it'll start the program and you'll end up with a file with your save codes like in the image below

## Disclaymer
I did this tool because I'm a bit lazy, but I held no responsibility for what could happen if you run this

Have a good day!
