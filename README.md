An auto save program that allows you to save a game from the vrchat world [Idle Home](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_c16e4dee-d149-4116-adbc-16bc30b664b0)
This works by going to vrchat's log file and getting the save string that you'd get when you click on the save button, or when it auto saves

## How to use the program
2 ways:
* Downloading python and running the program yourself
* Just run the executable that exists on the [releases page](https://github.com/fuzzyCute/Idle_home_Auto_save/releases/tag/version_1_0)

Uppon starting the program it'll ask you for a number, which will represent the time between each scan to the log file.
It'll then create a new file on your Desktop called *save_times.log* with the date followed by the code of the save.

I did this tool because I'm a bit lazy, but I held no responsibility for what could happen if you run this

Have a good day!
